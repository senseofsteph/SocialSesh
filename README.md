TBD

### Data

- User first name, last name, email, password, photo, breif personal bio, phone number and zipcode
- Event name, type, date, start time, duration, description, location, zipcode, photo

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User can create a event under a particular category
- User can search for an event, by filling out a form, under a particular category

#### 2.0

- Users can select which events they want to attend
- Attendee text message confirmation to user who created the event

#### 3.0

- Maps to pinpoint in-person event location
- Slicker UI with use of front-end technologies

### Notes
