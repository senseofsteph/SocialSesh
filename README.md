## Software Engineering Project Proposal

### Overview

A web app where users can connect, create, and contribute, through virtual events

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

Twilio SMS API: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api

### Data

- User first name, last name, email, password, and phone number
- Event name, type, date, start time, description, and photo

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User can browse through all virtual events
- User can register to "attend" a virtual event
- User receives an event confirmation text message

#### 2.0

- User can search for a virtual event under a particular category
- User can customize their profile with created events and interests

#### 3.0

- Slicker UI with use of front-end technologies

### Notes

- More to come!
