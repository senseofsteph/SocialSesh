## Project Proposal

### Overview

An app where users can connect, create, and contribute, through virtual events

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

Twilio SMS API: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api
Python Faker Library: https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/

### Data

- User first name, last name, email, password, photo, breif personal bio, phone number
- Event name, type, date, start time, duration, description, location, photo

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User can create a event under a particular category
- User can search for an event, by filling out a form, under a particular category

#### 2.0

- Users can select which events they want to attend
- Attendee text message confirmation sent to user who created the event

#### 3.0

- Maps to pinpoint in-person event location
- Slicker UI with use of front-end technologies

### Notes

- More to come!
